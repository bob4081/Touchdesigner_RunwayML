Toe File that demonstrates communication between [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) and Touchdesigner using new SocketIO DAT.  Rate-limiting step of speed will be the GPU you are running the machine learning model on.  NOTE: Running some of these models sometimes takes a few seconds to return a single frame.  Try reducing resolution of images or beef up your GPU or use a TPU :)
